- 👋 Hello, I'm Mizky, brazilian digital artist, student and streamer! I'm 21 years old and I'm starting to learn code!
- 👀 I'm interested in RPG, Comin Books, animation. Additionally, I learn codes to make my games, web pages and plugins!
- 🌱 I'm currently learning about front-end (Css, HTML and JavaScript). But in the future, I will be learning Java, C# (I already know a little more about this one) and Python.
- 💞️ I'm new here, so I'm looking to collaborate with others to learn more!
- 📫 How to reach me on Twitter and Tumbrl too (@ByMizky)
- 😄 Pronouns: She/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm also a digital artist! (@Myzky_)
